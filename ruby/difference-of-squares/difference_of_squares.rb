# NOTES
# Getting some practice with inject.
# Inject has a special syntax that lets you take every
# item in an array and add, subtract, multiply, etc.
# pretty cool.
# I had the pleasure of attending Ruby Conf in 2015 and saw this talk by Michael Hartl expliaining #inject, #collect, #select, #reject, and other enumerables. Worth watching and coding along...
